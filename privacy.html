    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">
      Last updated: 16 November 2025
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Breastfeeding Smart</strong> (the “App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application and this support website.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.
      If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. About the App</h2>
    <p>
      Breastfeeding Smart is designed to help parents track breastfeeding, pumping, baby activities (such as sleep and diapers), and the mother’s daily water intake. The App is intended for informational and organizational purposes only and does <strong>not</strong> provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to collect and store only the minimum information necessary to operate and improve the App.
    </p>

    <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Baby and activity data:</strong> breastfeeding sessions, pumping times, sleep, diaper changes, water intake and similar logs you choose to record in the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support communication:</strong> if you contact us by email at
        <a href="mailto:accslabteam@gmail.com">accslabteam@gmail.com</a>, we will receive your email address and the content of your message.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subscription-related information:</strong> information about your purchase status (for example, whether you are on a free trial or active subscription) as provided by the App Store or any subscription management service we use.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>
      When you use the App, certain technical information may be collected automatically, for example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type, operating system version, language, and country/region settings.</li>
      <li>App version and basic usage information (such as which screens are opened and basic interaction events).</li>
      <li>Crash logs and performance data to help us identify and fix problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is generally aggregated and does not directly identify you as an individual.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We may use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide the core functionality of the App (tracking breastfeeding, pumping, activities, and water intake).</li>
      <li>To maintain and improve the stability, performance, and user experience of the App.</li>
      <li>To understand how the App is used (for example, which features are most helpful).</li>
      <li>To respond to your questions, feedback, or support requests.</li>
      <li>To manage subscriptions, purchases, and restore access on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Activity data (such as breastfeeding logs and water intake) is primarily stored on your device and/or in secure cloud storage systems used by the App.
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
      However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may use trusted third-party service providers to support features such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>App distribution and in-app purchases (e.g., Apple App Store).</li>
      <li>Subscription management and purchase validation.</li>
      <li>Analytics and crash reporting (to improve stability and usability).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These providers process data on our behalf in accordance with their own privacy policies. We do not sell your personal data to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended to be used by adults (such as parents and caregivers) to organize baby care.
      It is <strong>not</strong> directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      If you believe that a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:accslabteam@gmail.com">accslabteam@gmail.com</a>, and we will take steps to delete such information.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Health and Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      Breastfeeding Smart does not provide medical advice.
      Any information presented in the App is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
      Always seek the advice of your physician, pediatrician, or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your country or region, you may have certain rights regarding your data, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access or review certain information stored about you.</li>
      <li>The right to correct or update information you have entered.</li>
      <li>The right to request deletion of data that is not required for legal or legitimate business purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many of these actions can be done directly by you through your device (for example, by deleting the App or clearing data). If you need assistance, you can contact us at
      <a href="mailto:accslabteam@gmail.com">accslabteam@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      We may process and store information in countries other than your country of residence.
      By using the App, you consent to the processing of your information in these locations, where data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example to reflect changes to the App or to applicable laws.
      When we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
      We encourage you to review this Policy periodically.
    </p>
